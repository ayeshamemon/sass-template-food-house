# sass-template-food-house

In this project i have made a one page website for a food house.
It is a one page template for a restaurant.

Here i have used HTML5, SASS which is a CSS extension language and a bit of Pure Javascript.
I have not used any libraries or frameworks here.It is pure JS.

The output of code with screenshots have been added in the output folder.

Thank you!
